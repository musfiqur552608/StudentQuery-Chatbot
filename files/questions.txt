Generel science is an interesting subject which includes physics, biology and chemistry, foshil science.

Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data.

cosA = (b2 + c2 - a2) / (2bc).

sin(A+B) = sinAcosB + cosAsinB.

sin(A-B) = sinAcosB - cosAsinB.

Derivative Lows : c = 0,    
                x = 1,  
                ax = a, 
                x^2 = 2x,   
                sqrt(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2).
